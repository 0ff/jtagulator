1.2:
------
Release date: **August 7, 2014**

* Added extended IDCODE decoding based on IEEE 1149.1 specification for easier/quicker identification of manufacturer, part number, and version (thanks to Bob Heinemann)

* Modified `UART_Scan` to display previously entered string (if any) as default and to accept hex values (when `\x` is used as the string prefix, ignore MSBs if they are NULL). 

* Changed command input to require that commands are terminated with a single CR or LF, instead of executing immediately after the character was entered.

* Added local echo into `Parallax Serial Terminal.spin` (thanks to HexView). This will make using JTAGulator easier across different terminal programs, many of which don't provide local echo by default.

* Added progress indicators (display a character on the screen and blink LED) to show that JTAGulation is active/working (`Display_Progress`)

* Added support for detecting the optional JTAG nTRST pin. This pin is often pulled low on target systems, which will intentionally disable the JTAG interface. If it isn't one of the pins connected to the JTAGulator, the interface might not be discovered.

* Fixed/modified JTAG routines to more closely conform to the IEEE 1149.1 specification (thanks to Bryan Angelo @ Qualcomm).

* Added command to display firmware version information (`J`).

* Added JTAGulator logo and welcome message to start-up text.

* Minor code cleanup, optimizations, fixes to UI/input sanitization

* Release for [Black Hat USA 2014 Tools Arsenal][3].


1.1.1:
------
Release date: **August 6, 2013**

* Modifed `UART_Scan` and `UART_Passthrough` to stop the UART cog (`jdcogserial`) at the end of their functions. This prevents the cog from maintaining control of the pins, which would prevent subsequent, non-UART commands from working.


1.1:
----
Release date: **August 1, 2013**

* Added support for UART discovery and pass through mode (8N1).

* Adjusted `Set_JTAG` to only ask for the three required pins (TDO, TCK, TMS) when getting JTAG Device ID.

* Modified `Set_Target_Voltage` to allow you to turn off the target voltage output (VADJ).

* Re-organized code by subsystem (e.g., UART, JTAG, General).

* Release for [Black Hat USA 2013][2].


1.0.1:
------
Release date: **June 11, 2013**

* Added linefeeds to text output (for terminal programs that require CR+LF instead of just CR to display properly).

* Minor code cleanup.


1.0:
----
Release date: **April 24, 2013**

* Initial release for [DESIGN West 2013][1].
